## How to write a class
```
" Example: Create class number 30.
" First, get the structure of the classes from a previous class
cp class-21.Rmd class-30.Rmd
" Then, write the content in class-30.Rmd
" Add the links to class-30.Rmd in index.Rmd
vim index.Rmd
" Add the links to class-30.Rmd in _site.yml
vim _site.yml
```

## Build a single class

```bash
" Compile the class
bash compile.sh class-21.Rmd
" Compile the new index page
bash compile.sh index.Rmd
" Copy the htmls generated to the web/ directory
mv class-21.html web/
mv index.html web/
" Now, you can open the html's in the /web directory in your browser and check the results
xdg-open web/class-21.html
```

## Build the entire web
